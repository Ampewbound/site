  <h1>So you wanna help develop the site?</h1>
  <p class="ul">Languages</p>
  <ol>
    <li>First, obviously, you're gonna want to learn HTML, which is, basically, what makes websites. It's definently the easiest of the three, and I reccomend that you get started over at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">W3Schools (the creators of HTML)</a> or over at <a href="https://codecademy.com/learn/web">CodeCademy</a>. I used CodeCademy's tutorial, but I'd bet W3Schools is a bit better. If niether of those options (for some reason) suit you, there's plenty more with a quick search. But, trust me, it is not hard at all.</li>
    <li>Second, you're going to want to learn CSS. It's what makes websites look like... websites. CSS is what is making the font of this page Calibri, the background black, the border grey and the text white, as well as all of the spacing and things like italics. The earlier mention of <a href="https://codecademy.com/learn/web">CodeCademy's tutorial</a> includes CSS, and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp">W3Schools</a> has one as well (since, after all, they did create it).</li>
    <li>(Optional, for now) Thirdly, JavaScript is what makes things look <span id="fancy">fancy</span> and sleek. This is not required, but you might want to go take a gander at it. From what I can gather, <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp">W3Schools's tutorial</a> appears far superior to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript">CodeCademy's</a>, but this is entirely up to preference.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="ul">GitHub</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Obviously this site is hosted on GitHub. Projects on GitHub are in repositories. In order to actually contribute, you must first <span class="bold">fork, or copy, <a href="https://github.com/Ampewbound/site">the repository</a> to your own account.</span></li>
    <li>Second, you need to submit a <span class="bold">pull request</span> (a request for the pushing of your update) once you make your desired edit. The guidelines for pull requests for this site are as follows.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Try to only submit a single change in each pull request. It does not matter the <span class="bold">size</span> of the change, but simply <span class="bold">what</span> you change.</li>
      <li>Try to accurately name the request based on your changes, followed by the date and your name. For example:<br><br>BodyOverhaul_8-23-16_Landon or MarginAdjustments_8-26-16_Logan<br></li>
    </ul>
    <li>Send the request and you are finished! Your request will be reviewed and, if all is liked and accepted, will be pushed to the main site. Sometimes you will find that one of your updates made it through but not the pull request that made it. That would be because one change was like, and another wasn't. This is why you should only put one change in one pull request. Also, be sure that I know what username you are operating under.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Thanks for reading! Remember, anything in this list (guidelines, instructions, ect.) are subject to change. I will try to notify you when it is updated.</p>
